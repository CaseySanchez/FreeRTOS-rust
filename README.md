# FreeRTOS-rust
Rust crate for FreeRTOS

The crate is based on code from [freertos.rs](https://github.com/hashmismatch/freertos.rs).

It provides helper for you `build.rs` to make it easy to compile a embedded Rust application based on FreeRTOS. 
In contrast to freertos.rs the `main()` is written in Rust.

To build a project using this create see [freertos-cargo-build](freertos-cargo-build/README.md)

The runtime dependency for you FreeRTOS Rust application will be [freertos-rust](freertos-rust/README.md)

To get started there are examples in [freertos-rust-examples](freertos-rust-examples/README.md)
